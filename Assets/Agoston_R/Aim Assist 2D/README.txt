Thank you for downloading Aim Assist 2D. 

You may find the relevant scripts inside the Scripts folder. 
All assets that are needed for the demo only are part of the DemoAssets folder.
The platformer demo is based on Unity's platformer example, while the space shooter is a quick self-made game. 

See the full documentation to see how to use or adjust the aim assists.
